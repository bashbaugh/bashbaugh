:rocket: I'm currently working on a few projects, including my [Hack Club Summer of Making](https://hackclub.com/) project, a Donkeycar-inspired robocar :car: based on the Raspberry Pi 4 with OpenCV computer vision and tensorflow behavioural cloning. View the [repo](https://github.com/scitronboy/robocar) and my [summer scrapbook](https://scrapbook.benjaminashbaugh.me/).

:telescope: I'm also working on my [thesaurus Chrome extension](https://github.com/scitronboy/simply-synonyms) and trying to figure out networking for my [multiplayer math game](https://arithmerace.com/).

Some of my favorite languages include Python, Javascript and Typescript, and C#. Some of my favorite libraries :books: and frameworks include Flask, Keras, Express, and Vue.

:seedling: I also want to learn Flutter/Dart and Rust.
