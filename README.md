:telescope: I'm currently working on a few projects, including a concept for a "decentralized social idea network", and my [thesaurus Chrome extension](https://github.com/scitronboy/simply-synonyms).

:thinking: The other day I made [tools.bweb.app](https://tools.bweb.app/), a small collection of useful productivity tools. I'm also experimenting with Flutter.

<!-- :rocket: -->

Some of my favorite languages include Python, Javascript/Typescript, and C#. Some of my favorite libraries :books: and frameworks include Flask, Keras, Express, and Vue.

:seedling: I also really want to Rust but haven't yet thought of any projects that it would be a good fit for. 

For more information about me and to see a few of my previous projects, visit my website :computer: at [benjaminashbaugh.me](https://benjaminashbaugh.me/)
