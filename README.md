:rocket: I'm currently working on a few projects, including my [Hack Club Summer of Making](https://hackclub.com/) project, a Donkeycar-inspired robocar :car: with OpenCV computer vision and tensorflow behavioural cloning. View the [repo](https://github.com/scitronboy/robocar) and my [summer scrapbook](https://scrapbook.benjaminashbaugh.me/).

I'm also brainstorming ideas for my entry for this year's [Congressional App Challenge](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/).

Some of my favorite languages include Python, Javascript and Typescript, and C#. Some of my favorite libraries :books: and frameworks include Flask, Keras, Express, and Vue.

For more information about me and to see a few of my previous projects, visit my website :computer: at [benjaminashbaugh.me](https://benjaminashbaugh.me/)
