### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Benjamin Ashbaugh and I'm a 15yo computer-enthusiast, programmer, and student from Lafayette, Colorado. 

I'm currently working on a few projects, including my [Hack Club Summer of Making](https://hackclub.com/) project, a Donkeycar-inspired robocar with OpenCV computer vision and tensorflow behavioural cloning. View the [repo](https://github.com/scitronboy/robocar) and my [summer scrapbook](https://scrapbook.benjaminashbaugh.me/).

I'm also brainstorming ideas for my entry for this year's [Congressional App Challenge](https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/).
